# Big Data VR Project
The Big Data VR project aims to build a VR proof-of-concept biomedical data exploration and visualisation tool utilising the HTC Vive.  This script generates 3 synthetic datasets (of observation size 15500, 155000 and 1550000 respectively) simulated from data held by the ALSPAC birth cohort study (www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac) that were used during the project.
