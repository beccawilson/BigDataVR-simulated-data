The Big Data VR project aimed to build a VR proof-of-concept biomedical data exploration and visualisation tool utilising the HTC Vive in collaboration with Masters of Pie and Lumacode. 

This script generates 3 synthetic datasets (of observation size 15500, 155000 and 1550000 respectively) simulated from data held by the ALSPAC birth cohort study (www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac) that were used during the project.  It also checks that the attributes of the simulated data matches that of the cohort data.
